text = {The theory of Gr\"{o}bner bases, invented by Bruno Buchberger, is a general method by which many fundamental problems in various branches of mathematics and engineering can be solved by structurally simple algorithms. The method is now available in all major mathematical software systems. This book provides a short and easy-to-read account of the theory of Gr\"{o}bner bases and its applications. It is in two parts, the first consisting of tutorial lectures, beginning with a general introduction. The subject is then developed in a further twelve tutorials, written by leading experts, on the application of Gr\"{o}bner bases in various fields of mathematics. In the second part are seventeen original research papers on Gr\"{o}bner bases. An appendix contains the English translations of the original German papers of Bruno Buchberger in which Gr\"{o}bner bases were introduced.},

title = {An Introduction to Gr\"{o}bner Bases},
abstract = {As the primary tool for doing explicit computations in polynomial rings in many variables, Grobner bases are an important component of all computer algebra systems. They are also important in computational commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This book provides a leisurely and fairly comprehensive introduction to Grobner bases and their applications. Adams and Loustaunau cover the following topics: the theory and construction of Grobner bases for polynomials with coefficients in a field, applications of Grobner bases to computational problems involving rings of polynomials in many variables, a method for computing syzygy modules and Grobner bases in modules, and the theory of Grobner bases for polynomials with coefficients in rings. With over 120 worked examples and 200 exercises, this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students. It would be suitable as a supplement to a course in commutative algebra or as a textbook for a course in computer algebra or computational commutative algebra. This book would also be appropriate for students of computer science and engineering who have some acquaintance with modern algebra. },

title = {A Singular Introduction to Commutative Algebra},
abstract = {This book can be understood as a model for teaching commutative algebra, taking into account modern developments such as algorithmic and computational aspects. As soon as a new concept is introduced, it is shown how to handle it by computer. The computations are exemplified with the computer algebra system Singular developed by the authors. Singular is a special system for polynomial computation with many features for global as well as for local commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.
The book includes a CD with a version of Singular for various platforms (Unix/Linux, Windows, Macintosh), including all examples and procedures explained in the book. The book can be used for courses, seminars and as a basis for studying research papers in commutative algebra, computer algebra and algebraic geometry.

abstract = {This work presents a new framework for Gröbner-basis computations with Boolean polynomials. Boolean polynomials can be modelled in a rather simple way, with both coefficients and degree per variable lying in {0,1}. The ring of Boolean polynomials is, however, not a polynomial ring, but rather the quotient ring of the polynomial ring over the field with two elements modulo the field equations x2=x for each variable x. Therefore, the usual polynomial data structures seem not to be appropriate for fast Gröbner-basis computations. We introduce a specialised data structure for Boolean polynomials based on zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs), which are capable of handling these polynomials more efficiently with respect to memory consumption and also computational speed. Furthermore, we concentrate on high-level algorithmic aspects, taking into account the new data structures as well as structural properties of Boolean polynomials. For example, a new useless-pair criterion for Gröbner-basis computations in Boolean rings is introduced. One of the motivations for our work is the growing importance of formal hardware and software verification based on Boolean expressions, which suffer–besides from the complexity of the problems –from the lack of an adequate treatment of arithmetic components. We are convinced that algebraic methods are more suited and we believe that our preliminary implementation shows that Gröbner-bases on specific data structures can be capable of handling problems of industrial size.}
